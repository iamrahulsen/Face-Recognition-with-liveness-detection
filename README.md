# Face recognition with liveness detection

The application clicks pictures and checks with the help of the existing neular network that it is an alive human or not and if the model is more than 95% confident that it is an alive person, then it checks if that person has access or not. If that person is know by the model than it unlocks the application.



### How to run:
